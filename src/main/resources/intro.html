<div style="color: #333;">
	<p>Vornitologist is an example app for Vaadin TouchKit. The birds are
		real (the data is from Wikipedia and birdlife.fi) but the observation
        backend just produces some random dummy data.</p>
	<p>Vornitologist is built to demonstrate some of the many TouchKit features like:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Camera usage (via the Upload component) - attaching a photo to an
			observation</li>
		<li>Geolocation - on app startup</li>
		<li>Fallback mode for offline usage</li>
		<li>NavigationManager, NavigationView, NavigationButton - digging
			into the classification hierarchy in the "Birds" tab</li>
		<li>Popover - adding an observation, showing details</li>
		<li>TabBarView - as a main view</li>
		<li>Html5 style inputs - on the "Settings" view</li>
		<li>Extensibility - e.g. Vaadin Charts and a map add-on is used</li>
		<li>Integration testing using <a href="http://vaadin.com/add-on/testbench/">TestBench</a></li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		On iOS it is suggested to be used as a 'homescreen web app', which
		means you should <strong>bookmark it to your home screen and start it</strong>
        from there. When started via the home screen, the browser chrome is
		hidden and more space is available for the user interface of the application.
	</p>
	<p>Offline mode operation can be simulated using the "Go offline"
		button. Another, more realistic, way of testing the offline mode is using
        "airplane mode" on your device. Note, that you must first use the
        application online for a period of time, typically around 10 seconds, until
        the application has been cached locally. On a slow network it may take much
        longer to download all the relevant resources.
